This is an attempt to add more accurate names to the already excellent Ello's DPS mod.

Changes from the original:
- Attack is consolidated into a single source
- Special is consolidated into a single source
- Cast, Dash-Strike, Dash-Upper are named as such
- Traps are consolidated

Known issues:
- Not all abilities are updated yet
- Dusa summon tracks as Enemy Deflect/Charm
